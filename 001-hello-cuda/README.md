# The Basics!
This is the first ever CUDA programs that any CUDA programmer writes. It is the equivalent of the "Hello World!" program in CUDA. The program is compiled using the `nvcc` compiler. The programs are run on the GPU to compute. It consists of two scripts:

## Hello CUDA
The most basic CUDA program. It is a simple program that utilizes the CPU and GPU to print a string onto the sceen.
The program explains on how to call the CPU and the GPU. The program is compiled using the following command.
```bash
nvcc hello_cuda.cu -o hello_cuda.out
./hello
```

## Compute CUDA
It is a simple program that adds two vectors together. The program is timed on the GPU. The program is timed on the CPU. The program is timed on the GPU and CPU. The program's timing reports are generated by using Nsight Systems. The program is compiled using the following command.
```bash
nvcc compute_cuda.cu -o compute_cuda.out
nsys profile --stats=true ./compute_cuda.out
```
An examply profile report can be seen in profile.txt file
